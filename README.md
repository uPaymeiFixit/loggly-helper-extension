# loggly-helper-extension

An extension which parses stringified JSON, most commonly found in the raw log.

Loggly has a limited number of indexes, so users find themselves sending stringified JSON, which is difficult to read. This extension will find any pars-able JSON on the page and format it.

For users weary of or unable to install an extension, a bookmarklet.js file is provided. ([Instructions](https://support.smartbear.com/crossbrowsertesting/docs/test-runs/bookmarklet.html))
