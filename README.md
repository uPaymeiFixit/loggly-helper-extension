# loggly-helper-extension

An extension which parses stringified JSON, most commonly found in the raw log.

Loggly has a limited number of indexes, so users find themselves sending stringified JSON, which is difficult to read. This extension will find any pars-able JSON on the page and format it.

It also supports limited ANSI coloring.
