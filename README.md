# loggly-helper-extension
A chrome extension which parses stringified JSON, most commonly found in the raw log.

Loggly has a limited number of indexes, so users find themselves sending stringified JSON, which is difficult to read. This extension, which began as a bookmarklet, will find any pars-able JSON on the page and format it.
